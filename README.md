## Key Features

### Leaderboard & Score Verification

A fully featured leaderboard lets players submit screenshots and claim high scores. Submissions go through a lightweight verification flow handled by the DuckMath moderation team to keep cheat submissions low and maintain fair competition.

- Upload screenshot proof when submitting a score
- Manual verification queue + automated checks (file metadata, timestamp, visual heuristics)
- Public leaderboard per game and global leaderboard pages

### Authentication (Supabase)

We use Supabase Auth to keep login simple and stateless across our multiple links. This lets players remain logged in across mirror links and proxies without re-authenticating constantly.

- Social logins and email/password available
- Token-based sessions stored safely in secure cookies/local storage
- Lightweight serverless rules for cross-domain session checks

### Coins & In-Game Economy

Players earn coins while playing and can spend them in the site shop for cosmetic items like cursors, backgrounds, badges, and limited-time items.

- Earn coins through gameplay, daily logins, and events
- Spend coins in a cataloged store with previews and ownership
- Transaction logs and rollback support for moderators

### Battlepass & Seasons

Inspired by popular seasonal systems, DuckMath’s Battlepass runs in seasons (current season: **Medieval Times**) where players earn XP to unlock rewards.

- Season XP earned through playing and completing challenges
- Free and premium reward tracks (premium items purchasable with coins)
- Seasonal badges and exclusive cursors

### Games Catalog

A curated library of browser-friendly games (HTML5, WebGL, iframe wrappers for some remote hosts). Popular examples on the site include titles like *Omori Online (unblocked)*, *Deltarune Web*, and Roblox via now\.gg links.

- 250+ games sorted by category and popularity
- Daily updates and featured games carousel
- Search + filters (genre, multiplayer, new, trending)

### Proxies & Cloak Mode

DuckMath integrates multiple trusted proxy backends (holyunblocker, rammerhead, ultra violet web proxy) so players can access content from networks that would otherwise block the target domains.

- Pick different proxy backends to improve reach and reduce downtime
- Cloak Mode: change your browser tab title and favicon to look like a classroom page (example: Google Classroom or about\:blank) for discreet browsing
- Important: Use proxies responsibly and follow local rules and school policies.

### Discord Integration

We embed Discord chat using widgetbot.io so players can join in-site chat without leaving the page or logging into a separate client.

- Chat widget with moderation and channel selection
- Optional linking to the full Discord server

## How To Deploy (Quick)

If you want to fork and host DuckMath locally or publicly, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/duckmath.git
cd duckmath
```

2. Run locally for quick testing:

```bash
npx serve
# or, if you prefer python's simple server:
# python3 -m http.server 8080
```

3. Deploy to a static host:

- **Vercel**: `vercel --prod` (recommended for automatic CI/CD)
- **Cloudflare Pages**: connect GitHub repo and set the build to `npm run build` if you have a build step, or use direct static deploy.
- **GitHub Pages**: publish the `main` branch or the `gh-pages` folder.

4. Configure DNS or custom domains (if desired), enable HTTPS, and test proxies and auth flows.

## Recommended Hosting & Tips

- Use an edge/CDN backed host (Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, Netlify) to keep latency low for players in different regions.
- Enable Brotli/Gzip compression and long cache headers for static assets to improve load times.
- Use a lightweight serverless function when you need to proxy auth or handle leaderboard submissions.

## Security & Privacy

- We store minimal PII. Authentication uses Supabase and secure tokens.
- Uploaded leaderboard images are scanned automatically and reviewed by moderators.
- Proxies are third-party services — review their policies and use them at your own risk.
